<!-- Over the next couple of weeks, you will be designing and building a recipe web page. This week's assignment is to choose a recipe, gather assets and build a responsive wireframe of the website.

Content must include:

Title
Description / teaser
Photo(s)
Ingredients list
Step-by-step instructions
Author / source attribution
Wireframe requirements:

Must limit content-area width to 960px
Must function down to 320px wide
Image must scale with window
Ingredients and instructions must be presented side-by-side above 640px
Focus on structure for now, decorative style comes later -->

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        2 medium ripe bananas (best when they have lots of brown spots)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 eggs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 ½ cups old fashioned rolled oats, gluten free if desired
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 teaspoons baking powder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ¼ teaspoon salt
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Olive oil, for cooking
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="instructions">
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <label>Step 1:</label> <br>Add all of the ingredients to a blender and blend on high until completely smooth, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Let the batter sit in your blender while you heat your pan up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <label>Step 2:</label> <br>Lightly coat a griddle with coconut oil, vegan butter or olive oil and place over medium heat. Once pan is hot, add 1/3 cup of the batter to the griddle for each pancake and cook for 2-4 minutes until
                        pancakes slightly puff up and you see a few bubbles along the edges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <label>Step 3:</label> <br>Flip cakes and cook until golden brown on underside. If you find that pancakes are browning too quickly then you need to lower the heat. I normally start on medium heat, then decrease to medium low later
                        so that my pancakes don't burn. If at any point your griddle starts smoking, it means your pan is too hot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <label>Step 4:</label> <br>Wipe skillet clean and repeat with more oil and remaining batter. Makes 9 pancakes total. Serves 3, 3 pancakes each.
                    </li>
