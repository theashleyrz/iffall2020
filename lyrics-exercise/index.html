                    <p> Take it back or let me go<p>    
                    <p>It's better if I tell you so <p> 
                    <p>I hurt you once before and I'll do it again </p>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>Everyone I know is gone and I don't even know myself<p>
                    <p>I'm saving up<p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>To take a trip to Mexico<p>
                    <p>I heard it's the place to go<p>
                    <p>I want to see the colors of another sky.<p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>Carry me home on your shoulders<p>
                    <p> Lower me onto my bed</p>
                    <p>Show me the night that I dreamed about before</p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>Lover you may cause me tears</p>
                    <p> Drag me through the best of years</p>
                    <p>You'll never know any of the songs I wrote</p>
                    <p> Older than a year or two</p>
                    <p> But I love you so</p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p> Oh, carry me home on your shoulders</p>
                    <p>Lower me onto my bed</p>
                    <p> Show me the night that I dreamed about before</p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>Carry me home on your shoulders</p>
                    <p>Lower me onto my bed</p>
                    <p>Show me the night that I dreamed about before</p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    <p>Lover you may cause me tears</p>
                    <p> Drag me through the best of years</p>
                    <p>But I love you so</p>
